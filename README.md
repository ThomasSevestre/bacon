# Bacon

This is my personal fork of the [bacon test](https://github.com/chneukirchen/bacon) framework tailored to my needs, here is
a non exhaustive list of changes worth mentioning:

- added a new default nicer output formatter, I look at tests most of my work days
  and got tired of the old standard look.
- added some optional extensions:
  - mocha integration: allow using mocha expectations
  - eventmachine integration: make your tests run inside the eventmachine loop
